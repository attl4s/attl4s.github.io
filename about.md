My name is Daniel López Jiménez and I am a Senior Security Consultant working at the company NCC Group.

I have been working in the security field since 2018. During this time, I have collaborated and offered security services to multiple clients around the world, understanding their needs and their complex environments, in order to give them appropriate recommendations and enhance their overall security posture against threats.

In terms of my areas of expertise, I would highlight infrastructure security, identity management technologies, cloud platforms, and Merge & Acquisitions (M&A). Particularly worthy of mention is my knowledge about Active Directory, technology on which I have been delivering Masterclasses since 2019 in a cybersecurity master's degree at Universidad Castilla La-Mancha (Spain).

In my spare time, I enjoy researching, studying and presenting topics such as Active Directory, Windows, threat simulation and enterprise security. I am a regular speaker in security conferences in Spain like Navaja Negra, H-c0n, nO Con Name and more. In addition, I hold several certifications from Offensive Security, Zero-Point Security and Pentester Academy mainly focused on enteprise security and threat simulation.
