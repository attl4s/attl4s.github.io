Daniel has been working on the security field since he finished his studies back in 2018, particularly focusing his efforts and motivation towards enterprise security and research (on-premise infrastructures, cloud platforms, identity management technologies and adversary simulation assessments).

Daniel has always been very interested in the world of Red Teaming and Blue Teaming, due to the importance they have in today's enterprise security. To be proficient in these areas, it is necessary to understand complex matters like how organizations normally work, how threat actors carry out their attacks, and how security teams protect and respond against these threats. All these topics are of great interest to him.

In his spare time, Daniel has been researching, studying and presenting on topics such as Active Directory, Windows, Operational Security, and privileged access security. He is a regular speaker in security conferences in Spain like Navaja Negra, nO Con Name and more, and he is an associate teacher in Castilla-La Mancha University, teaching about Active Directory Security.

In addition, Daniel holds several certifications from Offensive Security, Zero-Point Security and Pentester Academy mainly focused on Infrastructure Security and Red Team operations.
