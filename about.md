I've been immersed in the offensive security world since 2018, with a strong focus on large corporate infraestructures, identity technologies (like Active Directory or Azure AD/Entra ID) and evading network/endpoint detection and response solutions. This background enabled me to transition into my current role, dedicated exclusively to threat simulation / red teaming. I also enjoy sharing my learnings through presentations.
